# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance camera initialization and error handling
  - Modify eyeTracker.ts to improve camera initialization logic with detailed error reporting
  - Add visual status indicators for camera state (active, permission denied, HTTPS required)
  - Implement troubleshooting guidance display for common camera issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Fix voice command processing for "read aloud" commands
  - Update voiceInterface.ts to prioritize exact "read" and "read aloud" command matches
  - Implement strict command classification to prevent navigation when content reading is intended
  - Add context-aware command processing to handle post-navigation voice commands correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Implement interaction conflict resolution
  - Modify interactionManager.ts to prioritize voice commands over gaze detection
  - Add temporal conflict resolution to ignore gaze actions after voice commands
  - Implement context tracking to maintain interaction state and prevent unintended repeated actions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Add visual feedback and status indicators
  - Create camera status component to show initialization state and provide troubleshooting
  - Enhance voice command feedback to clearly indicate which action was interpreted
  - Add interaction conflict indicators to show when multiple inputs are detected
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.6_

- [x] 5. Create comprehensive error handling and fallback systems
  - Implement graceful camera fallback with clear user notifications
  - Add voice command error handling with disambiguation prompts
  - Create interaction state recovery mechanisms for conflict resolution failures
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5_

- [x] 6. Write unit tests for enhanced interaction systems
  - Create tests for camera initialization scenarios (HTTPS, permissions, hardware)
  - Write tests for voice command classification accuracy, especially "read aloud" vs navigation
  - Implement tests for interaction conflict resolution logic and priority handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Update Dashboard component to handle improved interaction events
  - Modify Dashboard.tsx to properly handle REPEAT actions for content reading
  - Add support for camera status display and troubleshooting guidance
  - Implement enhanced feedback for voice command interpretation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.6, 1.2_

- [x] 8. Integration testing and validation
  - Test camera initialization across different browsers and HTTPS/HTTP scenarios
  - Validate voice command accuracy with various "read aloud" phrasings and navigation commands
  - Verify interaction conflict resolution works correctly with simultaneous inputs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
