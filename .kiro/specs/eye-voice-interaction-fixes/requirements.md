# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the adaptive learning platform's eye tracking and voice command systems. Users are experiencing problems where the camera doesn't activate for gaze detection, and voice commands like "read aloud" are incorrectly triggering navigation actions instead of content reading functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Camera Initialization and Gaze Detection

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the camera to properly initialize for eye tracking so that I can navigate the interface using gaze detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions and initialize the camera feed
2. WHEN camera access is granted THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the camera is active
3. WHEN camera access is denied THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to alternative input methods with clear user notification
4. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL process video frames for basic face/gaze detection
5. IF the camera fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Voice Command Processing Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user relying on voice commands, I want "read aloud" commands to trigger content reading functionality so that I can hear lesson content without unintended navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "read aloud" THEN the system SHALL trigger the REPEAT action to read current content
2. WHEN a user says "read" THEN the system SHALL trigger the REPEAT action to read current content  
3. WHEN a user says navigation commands like "next" or "back" THEN the system SHALL only trigger navigation actions
4. WHEN voice commands are processed THEN the system SHALL prioritize exact command matches over partial matches
5. WHEN ambiguous voice input is detected THEN the system SHALL choose the most contextually appropriate action
6. WHEN a voice command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual and audio feedback about the action taken

### Requirement 3: Interaction Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user using multiple input methods, I want the system to handle conflicting inputs intelligently so that my intended actions are executed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple input methods trigger actions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize voice commands over gaze detection
2. WHEN a voice command is detected THEN the system SHALL ignore gaze-based actions for a brief period to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN navigation state changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain context to prevent unintended repeated actions
4. WHEN the user issues a "read aloud" command after navigation THEN the system SHALL read the current content, not navigate further
5. IF conflicting actions are detected THEN the system SHALL log the conflict and choose the most recent high-confidence input
